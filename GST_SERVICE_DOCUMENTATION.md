# GST Service Documentation

## AIM

To develop a comprehensive GST (Goods and Services Tax) filing service that automates tax calculations, manages vendor information, handles invoice processing, and provides secure API endpoints for GST compliance operations.

## Objective

The GST Service aims to:
- Streamline GST filing processes for businesses
- Automate tax calculations and Input Tax Credit (ITC) processing
- Provide secure vendor management with API key authentication
- Handle invoice lifecycle management and payment tracking
- Maintain ledger records for tax credit balances
- Send automated reminders for pending invoices
- Ensure data security through encryption and rate limiting

## Description

### Detailed Description

The GST Service is a Node.js-based web service built using Express.js framework that provides comprehensive GST management capabilities. The service follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns across presentation, application, business logic, data access, and database layers.

The system manages the complete GST filing workflow from vendor registration to tax calculation and filing submission. It handles complex business rules including ITC eligibility, penalty calculations, and tax offsetting mechanisms. The service supports multiple filing timeframes (monthly, quarterly, annual) and accommodates different merchant types with varying compliance requirements.

### Encryption Algorithm

The service implements **AES-256-GCM** encryption for secure data transmission:

**Encryption Specifications:**
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Length**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **IV Length**: 96 bits (12 bytes) - GCM standard
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication tag for integrity verification

**Implementation Details:**
- **Request Encryption**: All sensitive request payloads are encrypted using vendor-specific secret keys
- **Response Encryption**: API responses are encrypted before transmission
- **Key Management**: 64-character hex-encoded secret keys generated using crypto.randomBytes()
- **Payload Structure**: 
  ```json
  {
    "iv": "<hex>",
    "encryptedData": "<hex>",
    "authTag": "<hex>"
  }
  ```

**Security Features:**
- **Authenticated Encryption**: Prevents tampering and ensures data integrity
- **Unique IV per Operation**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Vendor-Specific Keys**: Isolated encryption per vendor
- **Secure Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure key generation

**Email Service Encryption:**
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and SHA-256
- **Salt**: 16-byte random salt per encryption
- **Base64 Encoding**: For safe transmission
